# RosterSystem-Inheritance
A simple Java project to practice OOP inheritance (Person, Student, Instructor)
# Inheritance Project 👩‍💻

A simple Java project I made to practice **OOP Inheritance**.  
The project has:  
- `Person` class (base)  
- `Student` class (inherits from Person)  
- `Instructor` class (inherits from Person)  
- `RosterTester` to test and print info  

This is just for training and learning purposes.
